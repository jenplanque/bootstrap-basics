## Introduction
This project was created for the mid-way knowledge check for [Coding Temple's](https://www.codingtemple.com) **Module 5 - Frameworks and Intro to Javascript** section, to help demonstrate how to use Bootstrap to create a responsive and visually appealing webpage. The webpage includes various Bootstrap components and utilities to showcase the capabilities of the framework.

## Features
- **Responsive Navbar**: A fixed-top navbar that collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller screens.
- **Registration Form**: A form with input fields for first name, last name, email (required), password (required), and a terms and conditions checkbox, including proper field validation.
- **User Submissions Table**: A table displaying pre-populated user submissions.
- **Image Gallery**: A section with images displayed using Bootstrap's responsive image classes and round pic styling.
- **Buttons**: Various buttons with different styles and sizes - one button gets hidden on smaller screens.
